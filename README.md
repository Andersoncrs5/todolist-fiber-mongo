# Project Description

This is a RESTful API developed using the Fiber web framework in Go, designed with clean architecture principles and SOLID design patterns. The application uses MongoDB as its database and implements DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to separate internal logic from request/response handling.

# Key features include:

 Input validation using structured DTOs to ensure data consistency and integrity.

 Basic filtering and pagination mechanisms to handle large datasets efficiently.

 Rate limiting to protect endpoints from abuse and ensure fair usage.

 API versioning to support backward compatibility and future improvements.

 Modular architecture, promoting testability and scalability through SOLID principles.

This project serves as a clean and scalable boilerplate for building production-ready APIs with Go and MongoDB.
